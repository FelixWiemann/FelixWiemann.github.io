Here is a selection of projects I have been or currently am working on in my free time.

<h2>My projects</h2>
<h3>Notes</h3>
An android app for creating, storing and managing your notes on your phone.

You can find its project page [here](/projects/notes)

<h2>Open source contributions</h2>

<h3>Microsoft google-play-vsts-extension</h3>

With it's Azure Devops environment Microsoft provides an online solution for collaborating in software development.
With the Pipelines-Feature continous integration/deployment is made possible. 

Microsoft provides some build or release plugins that are open source.

One of these plugins is a seamless integration with the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers) enables automated release, promotion and app updates to the playstore.

Here a feature was missing, where you could specify which version of the app should be promoted to the next release track.
I added that feature with this [pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/google-play-vsts-extension/pull/264).
